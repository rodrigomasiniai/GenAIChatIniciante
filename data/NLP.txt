Natural Language Processing (NLP) involves the interaction between computers and human languages. It enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is both meaningful and useful. NLP techniques are used to analyze and extract information from text, speech, and other forms of natural language data. Applications of NLP include sentiment analysis, language translation, chatbots, information retrieval, and more. NLP algorithms often involve machine learning and deep learning techniques to process and understand language patterns and structures.
