# ChatDOCx

### A chatbot powered by Hugging Face and Python

- Chat with your documents by asking questions on a user friendly web app.
- Summarize your documents.
- Too many links or contacts? Access them easily.
- Create your own custom domain e.g., development errors you would like to trace.
- Supports different NLP models from Hugging Face.

Here is an example where the bot answers a sample question on transformers:

<div align="center">
    <img src="data/images/question.jpg" alt="ChatDOCx" width="600"/>
</div>

> NOTE: ChatDOCx is experimental and may not work properly. Please provide context-based questions for better results.
